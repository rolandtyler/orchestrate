### Migrate steps from v2.5.x to v21.1.x

> IMPORTANT ! In order to perform this migration, Orchestrate has to be running on the latest minor version of v2.5.x
and been migrated to latest v21.1.x  

#### HashiCorp keys
In order to migrate your keys from `kv-v2` engine to `orchestrate` engine you need to follow the next steps:

1. Instantiate HashiCorp with both engines enabled: `kv-v2` and `orchestrate`
1. Initialize the following environment variables: 
    - `VAULT_ADDR`: HashiCorp host URL 
    - `VAULT_TOKEN_FILE`:  Disk path to token file valid for orchestrate engine
    - `VAULT_MOUNT_POINT`: Mounting point of orchestrate engine
    - `VAULT_V2_SECRET_PATH`: Path where keys are stored in kv-v2 engine 
    - `VAULT_V2_MOUNT_POINT`: Mounting point of kv-v2 engine
    - `VAULT_V2_TOKEN_FILE`:  Disk path to token file valid for kv-v2 engine
1. Execute command: 
```
$> orchestrate key-manager migrate import-secrets
```

#### Orchestrate Service Data
In previous versions of orchestrate each of the API service data was stored in a independent postgres DB. 
Therefore to update to `v21.1.x` you need to import each of service's data by following the next steps for
each of the service DBs you intend to migrate:

1. Initialize the following:
    - `DB_MIGRATION_SERVICE`: Source DB service name. Values are: "chain-registry", "transaction-scheduler" and "contract-registry"
    - `DB_MIGRATION_ADDRESS`: Source DB URL
    - `DB_MIGRATION_DATABASE`: Source DB name
    - `DB_MIGRATION_USERNAME`: Source DB username
    - `DB_MIGRATION_PASSWORD`: Source DB password
1. Execute command:
```
$> orchestrate api migrate copy-db
```

* The `tx-listener` produces kafka messages exclusively in the topic `topic-tx-decoded` instead of the `topic-tx-decoder-{chainID}`
* Merge the `tx-nonce` microservice into `tx-crafter` microservice. The `tx-crafter` publishes transactions directly in the `topic-tx-signer`
* All microservices, now, have to go through the `chain-registry` microservice to communicate with any Blockchain
#### Configuration
* Rename the default topic names from `topic-wallet-generator` and `topic-wallet-generated` to `topic-account-generator` and `topic-account-generated` respectively
* Move environment variables `NONCE_MANAGER_TYPE` `REDIS_URL` `REDIS_LOCKTIMEOUT` from the `tx-nonce` to the `tx-crafter`
* Remove environment variable `ETH_CLIENT_URL`, the chains urls have to be set at start-up in `CHAIN_REGISTRY_INIT` of `chain-registry` microservice or dynamically using the chain-registry API. 
* Remove environment variables `FAUCET_CREDIT_AMOUNT`, `FAUCET_BLACKLIST`, `FAUCET_COOLDOWN_TIME`, `FAUCET_CREDITOR_ADDRESS`, the faucets configurations are stored in the chain registry using its API. 
* Add the environment variable `CHAIN_REGISTRY_URL` to the `tx-listener`, `tx-crafter`, `tx-sender`
* Remove environment variable `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_TX` in the `tx-listener` and `tx-decoder`. The same feature can be found in the Chain-Registry API
#### API 
* Remove `/v1` prefix in the HTTP REST path for the `envelope-store` and the `chain-registry`
* Instead of producing and consuming envelopes to Orchestrate, a user will produce `TxRequest` and only consume `TxResponse`
